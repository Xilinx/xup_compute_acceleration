# Connecting to AWS

## Introduction

The following instructions are for attendees for whom an AWS F1 instance has been set by Xilinx, and have been provided with log-in details. If you are not intended to use F1 instance provided by Xilinx, go back to the [Quick Start](README.md) page and follow one of the other options to work through these labs.

This lab will guide you through the steps involved in connecting to a Xilinx provided AWS EC2 F1 instance, and starting and stopping the instance.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Connect to an AWS EC2 F1 instance using the provided credentials
- Start an instance
- Connect to a remote desktop using one of the different options (NICE DCV, noVNC or RDP)
- Stop the instance
- [Pre lab setup](#lab-setup), make AWS-FPGA and XRT available in the instance

## Steps
Each registered participant to Xilinx workshop/webinar has been allocated a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance and should have received an email with the following details:  

- Account ID
- IAM username
- Link to access a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance

### Login into the AWS and starting an F1 instance

1. Follow the link provided by your instructor, or go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) to open a login page (select **IAM user**). Use `xilinx-aws-f1-developer-labs` in *Account ID (12 digits) or account alias*. If you had used the link, then you should see a login page similar to shown here:

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-1.png)

1. Use the log in details provided to you

1. On the top right corner, using the drop-down button, make sure to select a region for F1 instances indicated by your instructor

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-3.png)

    If you select the wrong region you may not see your instance

1. Click on the **EC2** link on the dashboard or if not visible, then click on the _Services_ drop-down button and then click on **EC2**

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-4-2.png)

1. Click on the **Instances** link on the left panel

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-5.png)

    You may see several instances

1. Enter your username in the filter field just below the **Launch Instance** and select **Name:**\<username\> button and hit enter

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-6.png)

1. Make sure that your instance is selected, click on the **Instance state > Start**

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-7.png)

1. Wait for about 30 seconds and then click on the refresh button to see the updated status to *running*. This status update is not automatic, therefore the refresh button must be clicked.

    ![](./images/connecting_lab/Fig-refresh.png)

1. Select your instance again and copy the IPv4 Public IP which will be used by to access the remote instance.

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-9.png)

    **At this point you have three options to connect to AWS instance: NICE DCV, noVNC or RDP for desktop like interface, which have already been setup**

    You can also ssh to the instance using PuTTY for instance, see [appendix](#ssh-using-putty)

### Connect using NICE DCV

NICE DCV is recommended by Amazon and will be the primary option to remote desktop to the instance.

* Download and install the appropriate NICE DCV client if necessary from [here](https://download.nice-dcv.com). Make sure you have the latest version.

The NICE DCV session has already been started on the pre-configured instance. See the [Appendix](#set-up-the-nice-dcv-session) for details on how to setup a session.

1. Open the NICE DCV application on your computer, enter the *IPv4 Public IP* from the Amazon console and click **Open**

    ![](./images/connecting_lab/nice_dcv.png)

1. The first time a certificate warning will be displayed. Click **Trust** to continue

1. When prompted, enter the username and password provided by your instructor to connect to the instance.

    ![](./images/connecting_lab/nice_dcv_desktop.png)

1. Continue to [Lab setup](#lab-setup)

### Connect using noVNC

[noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC) runs in any modern browser and it is both a VNC client JavaScript library as well as an application built on top of that library. Therefore, you do not need to install any application.

1. Open a new tab in your Internet browser

1. Browse to `<IPv4 Public IP>:6080/vnc.html`

1. Click Connect

    ![](./images/connecting_lab/noVNC_connect.png)

1. Enter provided password

1. To copy from/to the remote instance you need to use the Clipboard option on the left sidebar

1. Continue to [Lab setup](#lab-setup)

<!---
1. You can scale the resolution by clicking Setting on the left sidebar and changing *Scaling Mode:* to Remote Resizing

    ![](./images/connecting_lab/noVNC_desktop.png)
-->

Known issues:

  - Remote Resizing does not work
  - Keyboard shortcuts only works in full screen mode

### Connect using RDP

1. On your computer, start a Remote Desktop Connection session
    * For MAC users should install *Microsoft Remote Desktop*
    * For Linux *Remmina* or *Vinagre*

1. Enter the *IPv4 Public IP* address

1. Click on the **Show Options**

    ![](./images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-10.png)

1. Select the **Display** tab and select *True Color (24 bit)* and click **Connect**

    ![](./images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-11.png)

1. A certificate warning will be displayed. Click **Yes** to open the RDP session

1. Enter provided credentials and click **OK**

  ![](./images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-12.png)

1. Continue to [Lab setup](#lab-setup)

Known issues:

  - If the color depth is not set to True Color(24 bit) some programs are not displayed properly


### Connect using VNC (Suggested for Mac users)

1. We suggest to install [RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/vnc/macos/) client

    Other alternatives for Linux-based OS are [Remmina](https://remmina.org/) or [Vinagre](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Vinagre)

1. Open the RealVNC client

1. Enter *IPv4 Public IP*:01 and then hit the enter key

    ![](./images/connecting_lab/vnc.png)

1. You will be informed that the connection is Unencrypted, click *Continue*

1. Enter the provided password and click **OK**

1. Continue to [Lab setup](#lab-setup)

## Lab setup

1. Execute the following to clone the *aws-fpga* repository and setup the Xilinx tools. `aws-fpga` includes the AWS F1 tools, Hardware Development Kit (HDK) and documentation

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR -b v1.4.16
    echo "export PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=$AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/Vitis/aws_platform/xilinx_aws-vu9p-f1_shell-v04261818_201920_2/" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/xup_compute_acceleration.git
    source ~/.bashrc
    source $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/vitis_setup.sh
    source $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/vitis_runtime_setup.sh
    ```

    The previous commands will:
    - Clone the AWS F1 tools
    - Setup the platform directory
    - Clone this repository to get source code
    - Source XRT
    - Source AWS F1 tools

## Appendix

### SSH using PuTTY

1. Start **PuTTY** or your preferred SSH client

1. Enter *centos@<IPv4\_Public\_IP>* in the **Host Name** field and **22** in the *Port* field  
    Make sure that SSH is selected as the Connection type

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-15.png)

1. Click **Open** and then **Yes** when PuTTY Security Alert is shown

    The PuTTY window will open. It will ask for the password (in case of the workshop). Enter the provided password

    ![](images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-17.png)

1. Enter **exit** to close the session

### Set up the NICE DCV session

1. Open PuTTY, and ssh to your instance as described on [SSH using PuTTY](#ssh-using-putty)

1. On the terminal, enter the following command to start the DCV server:

    ```sh
    dcv create-session --user centos centos
    ```
    By default NICE DCV runs in the TCP port `8443`

1. Verify dcv session

    If the output of `dcv list-sessions` should look like:

    ```sh
    Session: 'centos' (owner: centos)
    ```


1. Stop the firewall

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl disable firewalld
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld
    ```
