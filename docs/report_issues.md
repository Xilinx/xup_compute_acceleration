- Section in lab or page you found the issue

- How you are running the tutorial? Cloud (AWS) or on-premises

- Screenshots or code snippets if appropriate
    - Check how to [create and highlight code](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)

- Tools and OS versions if the issue is in a lab

    - `vitis -version`
    - `xbutil version`
    - `lsb_release -a`


Report the issue to your instructor or open a [new issue](https://github.com/Xilinx/xup_compute_acceleration/issues).
